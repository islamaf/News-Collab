## New updates
* User profiles added and users can see the posts they save along with their information.
* Like button feature added.
* Dislike button feature added.
* Save button feature added.
* Unsave button feature added.
* Users can only like a post once. More than 1 click on the like button still counts to only **1 like count**. This is checked by linking the User ID to the liked Post ID.
